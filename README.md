## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Our goal in the creation of this document is to not only improve consistency, but to also allow newer developers joining our discipline to have an easy to use reference point. Consistency is a key element of software quality and without it all of our efforts eventually turn to spaghetti.

Today at The Nerdery, the Ruby discipline is effectively the Ruby on Rails discipline. We do not do much pure Ruby work and we do not do Sinatra work. Thus, the focus of this document is not actually Ruby standards, but instead Ruby on Rails standards.

### Expectations

* Understand and follow the standards outlined in this document.
* Write code knowing that someone else might be maintaining it.
* Select tools that benefit the project.

### Goals

* Be consistent
* Be awesome
* Write good, maintainable code
* Remember to test all the things :)
