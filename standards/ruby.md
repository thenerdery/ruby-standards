# Ruby Language Standards

The Ruby community as a whole is fairly homogeneous and thoroughly focused on maintaining that community.  As a result, we have an excellent [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) available to us that puts forth most of the usual "how many tabs, how to name methods" sorts of questions.  At The Nerdery, we use this.

We are extremely fortunate in our community to have [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) available to use - which will automatically check for standards violations against the community Ruby Style Guide.  Please make sure that you use **and enforce** this on any of your Ruby projects.

```ruby
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'rubocop'
  end
```
